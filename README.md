Examples n' things for my R work

The output is under the 'articles' menu [here](https://martynk.github.io/MartysCookbook/).

# Notes

Ran *usethis::use_mit_license("MÃ¡rton Kiss")* to set up the licence.  

Ran *devtools::document()* to make the NAMESPACE document.  

Use *devtools::test()* to run the unit test(s).  

Website made by *pkgdown::build_site()*.

Use *devtools::check(document = FALSE, vignettes = FALSE)* to check the panckage's integrity.

Use *devtools::install()* to compile the package.

This is *the* goldmine for setting up your pkgdown site:
https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html 

This is how we should approach long reports & vignette formats:

Using 'renv' for package for version control.
Need to specify *Sys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD = "libcurl")* in order to work.

For pdf outputs, use the *pgdown::thesis_paged*. For html outputs, knit them with  my style.css.

## Workflow

Stuff needed in one place (in **vignettes/** directory:

 - The **.Rmd** file of whatever you'd like to push  
 
 - My **styles.css** for compiling the .html to my liking  
 
 - My **template_pdflike.html** template for compiling a modified 'thesis'-like document  
 
 - The **packages.bib** file for the file if any.  
 

```

input_file <- here::here("vignettes","example_relevel", "_relevel_report.rmd")  

precompile_quick_vignette(input_file)  

input_file_q <- here::here("vignettes","example_relevel", "_relevel_report_quick.rmd")  

compile_rmd_multiple_outputs(input_file_q)  

# Make sure the whole directory is in **vignettes/** 
# Make sure the end file doesn't have '_' at the beginning and run
# Without extension!
pkgdown::build_article("example_relevel/relevel_report_quick")

```

Then manually move the whole folder again to *docs/articles/..* (**SKIP** the duplicate file name) and update *'_pkgdown.yml'*.

*pkgdown::build_site()* will recompile all .Rmd-s including the slow original .Rmd-s if the folder remains in the *vignettes/* folder.
